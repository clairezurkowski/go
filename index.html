<b>Research interests:</b>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Claire Zurkowski is a postdoctoral scholar in the 
  Equilibrium Physics at Extreme Conditions (EPEC) group at Lawrence Livermore 
  National Laboratory. She received her Ph.D. in Geophysical Sciences from the 
  University of Chicago in 2021 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Earth and Planets 
  Laboratory, Carnegie Instruction of Washington before joining EPEC in 2022. 
  Claire specializes in the ultra-high-pressure crystallography, equations of state, 
  and melting of metals and geomaterials using synchrotron multigrain and powder diffraction 
  techniques in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC). She also works on designing 
  toroidal diamond anvils to expand the accessible static pressure range to the multi-megabar 
  regime. Claire’s work has been applied to a range of topics in physics and planetary sciences: 
  including, the mineralogy and light element composition of Earth and planetary cores, 
  chemical interactions at Earth’s core-mantle boundary, the thermodynamic history of 
  meteorites and terrestrial diamond inclusions, and the ultra-high pressure equations of 
  state of common pressure calibrants used in the DAC.

<!-- Sulfur is a primary alloying element in Earth's core and
investigating the iron-sulfide phase relations at high pressures and temperatures is
integral to constraining core chemistry and dynamics. Over the course of my PhD,
I have combined powder and multigrain X-ray diffraction techniques up to 200 GPa and
3500 K with scanning electron microscopy of recovered samples to examine Fe–S and Fe–S–O
phase relations. This work has revealed the complexity of the Fe–S system under
extreme conditions and the stability of several new Fe-rich sulfide structures.
