<b>Research interests:</b>
<p style="text-align:justify"> I am an experimental mineral physicist
  studying the chemistry and thermodynamics of Earth and planetary
  deep interiors. I specialize in the combined use of synchrotron
  single-crystal and powder diffraction techniques in the diamond
  anvil cell to explore petrological systems at multi-megabar
  pressures and temperatures (P-T) Currently in my postdoc, I am
  investigating high P-T post-post spinel transitions, iron charge
  ordering and cation partitioning in oxides and silicates, and the
  mineralogy of natural and synthetic diamond inclusions. This
  crystallographic research contributes to our understanding of
  the mantle structure of super-Earths, the chemistry and
  dynamics of Earth’s deep interior, and the formational
  environments of diamonds in Earth’s mantle.

<!-- Sulfur is a primary alloying element in Earth's core and
investigating the iron-sulfide phase relations at high pressures and temperatures is
integral to constraining core chemistry and dynamics. Over the course of my PhD,
I have combined powder and multigrain X-ray diffraction techniques up to 200 GPa and
3500 K with scanning electron microscopy of recovered samples to examine Fe–S and Fe–S–O
phase relations. This work has revealed the complexity of the Fe–S system under
extreme conditions and the stability of several new Fe-rich sulfide structures.
